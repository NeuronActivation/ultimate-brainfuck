# ultimate-brainfuck

Ultimate brainfuck is an brainfuck variant with an evil twist.

A counter is added to brainfuck programming. This counter starts from zero and increases by one for every character in the ultimate brainfuck program.

Every character is moved times the value of the counter. So, a brainfuck program with fifty characters the last character would have to be moved fifty times.

The character moves by taking the next value from order `><+-.,[]`. The last character `]` will continue from the beginning.

Using Ultimate Brainfuck for programming is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube with your feet—it's technically possible, but you might want to reconsider your life choices.
